# Consumer Complaints Analysis

## Overview
This project involves the analysis of consumer complaints data obtained from Kaggle. The dataset contains information about consumer complaints related to various products and services.

The goal of this project is to explore the dataset, perform data cleaning and analysis, and derive insights from the consumer complaints.

## Dataset Description
The consumer complaints dataset was obtained from Kaggle. It contains information such as the date of complaint, the product or service category, the specific issue, and additional details provided by consumers.

The dataset was preprocessed and cleaned to handle missing values and ensure data quality. Columns with lots of missing values were deemed unnecessary and dropped. Some columns with fewer null values had values changed to a more sensible explanatio. Data type was also changed for other columns.

## Analysis Tasks
The following analysis tasks were performed on the consumer complaints dataset:

1. Exploratory Data Analysis: Analyzed the distribution of complaints by product and issue categories.
2. Sub-product and Sub-issue Analysis: Explored the sub-products and sub-issues within each category.
3. Complaint Volume Over Time: Investigated the trend of complaint volumes over time.
4. Geographic Analysis: Examined the distribution of complaints across different states or ZIP codes.
5. Company Analysis: Analyzed the involvement of companies mentioned in the dataset and their response to consumer complaints.

## Technologies and Libraries Used
The analysis was performed using the following technologies and libraries:

- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Folder Structure
The repository structure is organized as follows:

README.md # Project documentation
dataset.csv # Cleaned consumer complaints dataset
analysis.ipynb # Jupyter Notebook containing the analysis code
markdown
Copy code

## Instructions to Run the Analysis
To run the analysis and reproduce the results, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure that Python and the required libraries are installed.
3. Open the `analysis.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook.
4. Run each cell in the notebook to execute the analysis steps.

## Results and Conclusions
The analysis revealed valuable insights into the consumer complaints data, including the most common products and issues, sub-product and sub-issue distribution, complaint volume trends over time, geographic patterns, and company response to complaints. These findings can help identify areas for improvement and inform decision-making processes.

## Future Work
Possible future work and enhancements for this project include:

- Conducting sentiment analysis on consumer complaint narratives.
- Implementing machine learning models for complaint classification or predicting complaint outcomes.
- Developing interactive visualizations for a more engaging user experience.
